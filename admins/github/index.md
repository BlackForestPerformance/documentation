# GitHub Repositories

## [Documentation] (This repository, hosted on GitHub Pages)

Any documentation to all IT related stuff. Like this document.

## [blackforestperformance.github.io] (GitHub Pages)

This is used a placeholder Website for the Domain [bfp-racing.de]. By the time writing this, it is used to display a "work in progress" text on the page.
This was done, so the URL can be shared in magazines even when unsure if we would have a public page by the time the magazine is printed.
