# GitHub Repositories

## [Documentation] (This repository, hosted on GitHub Pages)

Any documentation to all IT related stuff. Like this document.

## [blackforestperformance.github.io] (GitHub Pages)

This *was* used a placeholder Website for the Domain [bfp-racing.de]. It was used to display a "work in progress" text on the page.
That way, we were able to share the URL on Magazines and flyers, even when unsure if we would have a public page by the time the magazine is printed.

## [Mail Footer]

This holds the original version of the E-Mail footer.
